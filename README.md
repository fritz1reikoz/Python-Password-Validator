Welcome to the process of creating a password validator script in python. 
This Python script would check password strength based on criteria like length, character types (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols).
It could offer suggestions for stronger passwords.

See complete code: https://github.com/fritz1reikoz/Python-Password-Validator/blob/main/PPV.ipynb

If you're running the above codes on any other platform besides "Google Colab" and encounter  an error related to "matplotlib", Follow the following steps to fix the issue.

<b>matplotlib Fix:</b>

<b>Step 1:</b> Install pip - Check if you have pip already simply by writing pip in the python console. If you don't have pip, get a python script called get-pip.py, here: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py (You'll have use windows "Save As" option)

![pip](https://github.com/fritz1reikoz/Python-Password-Validator/assets/55414490/ab21a644-66b4-4a0f-a586-3e983abe5465)

<b>Step 2:</b> Take note of where the file got saved and cd the directory from command prompt. Run the get-pip.py script to install pip. You can write in cmd this line within quotes: "python .\get-pip.py"

<b>Step 3:</b> Now in cmd type: pip install matplotlib

And you should be through.
